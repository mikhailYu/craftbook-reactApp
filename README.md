## Craftbook

Craftbook is a social media site created by Mikhail Y. It is intended to be used as a way for users to share works that they are proud of, as well as work-in-progress updates of their creations. Artists, programmers and  anyone who loves to create can come together and interact with other passionate people.

Users are able to add friends, share pictures, like/comment on posts and customize their experience through hand-picked themes.

The website was created using ReactJS for the frontend and ExpressJS for the backend. All of the data is stored and sorted on a Mongodb database.

I hope that you enjoy the site!
